    <h2 id="section-intro"><em>Introduction</em></h2>

    <p> A <strong>superhero</strong> (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of heroic stock character who possesses
        supernatural or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling
        supervillains.
        <br> A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine), although
        the word superhero is commonly used for females also. Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered
        on such characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s. </p>

    <p>By most definitions, characters do not require actual superhuman powers or phenomena to be deemed superheroes.[1][2][3]
        While the Dictionary.com definition of "superhero" is "a figure, especially in a comic strip or cartoon, endowed
        with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime",[4] the longstanding Merriam-Webster dictionary
        gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally skillful
        or successful person"<sup>[5] </sup>Terms such as masked crime fighters, costumed adventurers or masked vigilantes
        are sometimes used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may not be explicitly referred to as superheroes
        but nevertheless share similar traits.</p>

    <p>Some superheroes use their powers to counter daily crime while also combating threats against humanity from supervillains,
        who are their criminal counterparts. Often at least one of these supervillains will be the superhero's archenemy.
        Some long-running superheroes such as Batman, Spider-Man, Superman, Captain America, Wonder Woman, Iron Man, the
        Flash, Wolverine, Green Lantern, and Hulk have a rogues gallery of many villains.</p>

    <h3>Early History</h3>

    <p>The word 'superhero' dates to at least 1917.[6] Antecedents of the archetype include such folkloric heroes as Robin Hood,
        who adventured in distinctive clothing.[7] The 1903 play The Scarlet Pimpernel and its spinoffs popularized the idea
        of a masked avenger and the superhero trope of a secret identity.[7] Shortly afterward, masked and costumed pulp
        fiction characters such as Zorro (1919), The Shadow (1930) and comic strip heroes, such as the Phantom (1936) began
        appearing, as did non-costumed characters with super strength, including Patoruzú (1928), the comic-strip character
        Popeye (1929) and novelist Philip Wylie's protagonist Hugo Danner (1930).[8]</p>

    <h2>Common Traits</h2>
    <p>Many superhero characters display the following traits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Extraordinary powers or abilities. Superhero powers vary widely; superhuman strength, the ability to fly, enhanced
            senses, and the projection of energy bolts are all common. Some characters like Batman, Mockingbird, the Phantom
            and the Question possess no superhuman powers but have mastered skills such as martial arts, espionage techniques,
            and applied or forensic sciences to a highly remarkable degree. Others rely on fantastical weapons or technology,
            such as Iron Man's powered armor suits, Green Lantern’s power ring, and trick arrows employed by Green Arrow
            and Hawkeye. Many characters supplement their innate superhuman powers with a special weapon or device (e.g.
            Captain America's shield, Wonder Woman's lasso and bracelets, Thor's weather manipulating hammer, and Wolverine's
            adamantium claws).

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>A strong moral code, including a willingness to risk one's own safety in the service of good without expectation
            of reward. Such a code often includes a refusal or strong reluctance to kill or wield lethal weapons.</li>
